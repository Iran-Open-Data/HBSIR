> translated by [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/)

### Overall Objective

The overall objective of this plan is to annually estimate the
average total costs, food (in 10 main traits), very food (in 10
general traits) and income of households, as well as to annually
estimate the changes in these averages at the national urban areas
level and to annually estimate the average total costs, food,
non-food and income of households at the urban areas level of each
of the provinces.

### Target Population

The target population includes all normal resident and group
households in the urban areas of the country. Non-resident normal
households and institutional households are excluded from this plan.

### Statistical Unit

The statistical unit is a normal resident or group household in the
country.

### Reference Period

The reference period for different questions is, depending on the
case, the past week, the past month, and the past 12 months.

### Data Collection Period

The data collection period of this plan is from April 1 of the
relevant year until the end of March of the following year.

### Data Gathering Method

The required information is collected through face-to-face interviews
with sample households and completion of questionnaires.

### Sampling Framework

The first stage sampling framework in this plan is the fourth baseline sample 
of household surveys that includes the first stage sampling units (clusters). 
Each cluster includes one block, part of a large block, or in some cases a set 
of several small blocks that are constructed based on information from the 
general population and housing census so that it includes at least 350 households.

The second stage sampling framework is a list of names and addresses of 
resident ordinary households and some groups in selected sample clusters from 
the baseline sample.

### Sampling Method

The samples in this plan are selected in three stages using probabilistic 
sampling methods. In the first stage, the sampling clusters of each stratum of 
the baseline sample are randomly selected using simple random sampling. In the 
second stage, in each sample cluster, six-household rotation groups are 
constructed and three rotation groups are determined for the survey in each 
year based on the rotation pattern. In the third stage, inside each of the 
rotation groups, two households are randomly selected as the main sample 
households and the remaining four households in the rotation group are 
considered as substitute households.

In addition to estimating parameter levels (estimating parameters at a 
specific point in time) in this plan, estimating changes is also of interest. 
To obtain both types of level and change estimates for parameters with 
acceptable accuracy, rotational sampling is used. Rotational sampling, by 
keeping part of the sample units fixed between two survey periods and changing 
the rest, provides the possibility to estimate both levels and changes of 
parameters. Optimal implementation of rotational sampling requires the use of 
a baseline sample.

The rotational pattern selected for this plan is the three in then out pattern, 
according to which during three years from each rotation group, which is 
equivalent to 2 sample households, at most 3 surveys are conducted. This means 
that a household, depending on the rotation group it belongs to, is included 
in the sample for a maximum of 3 years and after that it is permanently excluded 
from the sample. Every year, inside each cluster, surveys are conducted from 
three rotation groups (equivalent to 6 households) as follows:

1. The group that has entered the sample for the first time
2. The group that has been placed in the sample for the second time
3. The group that has been placed in the sample for the third time

Thus, the overlap between two years $t$ and $t+i$ is:

$$
O_{t,t+1} = 2/3    O_{t,t+2} = 1/3
$$

Every year, surveys are conducted from three rotation groups inside each 
cluster. The rotation pattern used in this plan is presented in the tables
